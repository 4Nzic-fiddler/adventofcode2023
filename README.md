My solutions to challenges from https://adventofcode.com/

This year, I'm choosing a language that I've never used before and which other people have expressed great frustration using and trying to learn: Zig. 

As a fallback, if I get tired of trying Zig, I will go to Nim -- another language I'm not familiar with but I have used a bit and find it fun.

If I get really stumped, Python will be my safey net because I really love Python!
